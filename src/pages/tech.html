        <h4>Payment</h4>
       <p>The Payment feature is a cornerstone of online commerce. Oursky has solid experience in designing user-friendly checkout flows and integrating major payment gateways. In an app development project with Wilson Parking, for instance, we integrated more than eight payment gateways in the app (e.g., Stripe, Paypal, Braintree, Credit cards, Alipay, WeChat), giving users more freedom to use their preferred payment method. More on the Wilson Parking case study.</p>

        <h4>Security by design</h4>
        <p>We handle sensitive information with utmost care, have incident reporting mechanisms in place, and perform security checks on a per-commit basis. Our DevSecOps philosophy allows us to bake security early into the development lifecycle. We build digital products that comply to the standards of the EU General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR), Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), and Payment Card Industry (PCI), among others. Our work with HL Insurance is an example.

        <h4>Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Integration</h4>
        <p>Most hardware and internet-of-things (IoT) products communicate with mobile devices via Bluetooth®, Wi-Fi, and ultrasound. Empowering your users with flexibility and freedom to control your hardware through their mobile devices makes for a more seamless digital experience. Our team has the expertise in integrating these protocols in applications. See how we made a cooking thermometer connected — and smarter.</p>

        <h4>Object and Facial Tracking</h4>
        <p>A common use of artificial intelligence (AI) in applications application is object or facial tracking. Oursky has been working with this technology since the advent of biometrics and facial or object detection on smartphones, integrating innovation with business needs. Some of the technologies we use include, but are not limited to: OpenCV, Tensorflow, Apple’s augmented reality (AR) kit/ARKit, and Apple’s Vision API.</p>
